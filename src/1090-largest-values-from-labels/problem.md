# Largest Values From Labels

There is a set of n items. You are given two integer arrays values and labels where the value and the label of the ith element are values[i] and labels[i] respectively. You are also given two integers numWanted and useLimit.
Choose a subset s of the n elements such that:

The size of the subset s is less than or equal to numWanted.
There are at most useLimit items with the same label in s.

The score of a subset is the sum of the values in the subset.
Return the maximum score of a subset s.

Example 1:

Input: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,1,2,2,3], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 1
Output: 9
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, third, and fifth items.

Example 2:

Input: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,3,3,3,2], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 2
Output: 12
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, second, and third items.

Example 3:

Input: values = [9,8,8,7,6], labels = [0,0,0,1,1], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 1
Output: 16
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth items.

Constraints:

- `n == values.length == labels.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= values[i], labels[i] <= 2 * 10^4`
- `1 <= numWanted, useLimit <= n`
