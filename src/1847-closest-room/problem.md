# Closest Room

There is a hotel with `n` rooms. The rooms are represented by a 2D integer array `rooms` where `rooms[i] = [roomId_i, size_i]` denotes that there is a room with room number `roomId_i` and size equal to `size_i`. Each `roomId_i` is guaranteed to be **unique**.

You are also given `k` queries in a 2D array `queries` where `queries[j] = [preferred_j, minSize_j]`. The answer to the `jth` query is the room number `id` of a room such that:

* The room has a size of **at least** `minSize_j`, and
* `abs(id - preferred_j)` is **minimized**, where `abs(x)` is the absolute value of `x`.

If there is a **tie** in the absolute difference, then use the room with the **smallest** such `id`. If there is **no such room**, the answer is `-1`.

Return _an array_ `answer` _of length_ `k` _where_ `answer[j]` _contains the answer to the_ `jth` _query_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rooms = \[\[2,2\],\[1,2\],\[3,2\]\], queries = \[\[3,1\],\[3,3\],\[5,2\]\]
**Output:** \[3,-1,3\]
**Explanation:** The answers to the queries are as follows:
Query = \[3,1\]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 3) = 0, and its size of 2 is at least 1. The answer is 3.
Query = \[3,3\]: There are no rooms with a size of at least 3, so the answer is -1.
Query = \[5,2\]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 5) = 2, and its size of 2 is at least 2. The answer is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** rooms = \[\[1,4\],\[2,3\],\[3,5\],\[4,1\],\[5,2\]\], queries = \[\[2,3\],\[2,4\],\[2,5\]\]
**Output:** \[2,1,3\]
**Explanation:** The answers to the queries are as follows:
Query = \[2,3\]: Room number 2 is the closest as abs(2 - 2) = 0, and its size of 3 is at least 3. The answer is 2.
Query = \[2,4\]: Room numbers 1 and 3 both have sizes of at least 4. The answer is 1 since it is smaller.
Query = \[2,5\]: Room number 3 is the only room with a size of at least 5. The answer is 3.

**Constraints:**

* `n == rooms.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `k == queries.length`
* `1 <= k <= 10^4`
* `1 <= roomId_i, preferred_j <= 10^7`
* `1 <= size_i, minSize_j <= 10^7`
